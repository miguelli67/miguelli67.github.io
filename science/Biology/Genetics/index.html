  <h2>🧬 What is Genetics?</h2>

  <p>
    Ever wonder why you look a bit like your parents — or why you might have your mom’s dimples and your dad’s curly hair? That’s all thanks to <strong>genetics</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="fun-box">
    ❓ <strong>Quick Thought:</strong> Can two brown-eyed parents have a blue-eyed baby?  
    <em>(Hint: Genetics might surprise you!)</em>
  </div>

  <p>
    Genetics is the science of how traits — like hair color, dimples, or even whether cilantro tastes like soap — are passed from parents to their children.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧪 <strong>Gene:</strong> A stretch of DNA that tells your body how to build something, like a protein. Think of it like a recipe in your genetic cookbook!
  </div>

  <p>
    You get two copies of each gene — one from your mom and one from your dad. These versions are called <strong>alleles</strong>. Some alleles are <strong>dominant</strong> (they show up even if there's only one), and some are <strong>recessive</strong> (they only show up if you have two).
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🍀 <strong>Example:</strong>  
    If <code>D</code> = dimples (dominant) and <code>d</code> = no dimples (recessive):  
    - <code>DD</code> = Dimples  
    - <code>Dd</code> = Dimples  
    - <code>dd</code> = No Dimples  
  </div>

  <p>
    Scientists also talk about <strong>genotype</strong> and <strong>phenotype</strong>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genotype</strong>: Your gene combo (like <code>Dd</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Phenotype</strong>: What you actually look like (you have dimples!)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧠 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some people think cilantro tastes like soap. That’s actually a genetic trait! If it tastes fine to you, you don’t have the “soap gene.”
  </div>

  <p>
    Genetics isn’t just about looks — it helps doctors understand diseases, helps farmers grow better crops, and explains why no two people (except identical twins) are exactly the same.
  </p>

  <p>Choose traits from two parents and see what kind of baby you’d get. (No diapers included.)</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>DNA and Genes</h2>
    <p>DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule shaped like a double helix. It’s made up of base pairs (A, T, C, G) and contains the instructions for building proteins. Genes are short sections of DNA that determine specific traits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Mendelian Genetics</h2>
    <p>Gregor Mendel’s experiments with pea plants laid the foundation of classical genetics. He discovered dominant and recessive traits, which we now use in Punnett squares to predict offspring traits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Mutations</h2>
    <p>Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. They can occur naturally or due to environmental factors like radiation and chemicals. Some mutations have no effect, while others can lead to genetic disorders.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Modern Genetics</h2>
    <p>Genetic technologies like CRISPR allow scientists to edit genes. The Human Genome Project has mapped all human genes, helping in disease treatment, ancestry research, and more.</p>
