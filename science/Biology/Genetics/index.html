  <h2>🧬 What is Genetics?</h2>

  <p>
    Ever wonder why you look a bit like your parents — or why you might have your mom’s dimples and your dad’s curly hair? That’s all thanks to <strong>genetics</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="fun-box">
    ❓ <strong>Quick Thought:</strong> Can two brown-eyed parents have a blue-eyed baby?  
    <em>(Hint: Genetics might surprise you!)</em>
  </div>

  <p>
    Genetics is the science of how traits — like hair color, dimples, or even whether cilantro tastes like soap — are passed from parents to their children.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧪 <strong>Gene:</strong> A stretch of DNA that tells your body how to build something, like a protein. Think of it like a recipe in your genetic cookbook!
  </div>

  <p>
    You get two copies of each gene — one from your mom and one from your dad. These versions are called <strong>alleles</strong>. Some alleles are <strong>dominant</strong> (they show up even if there's only one), and some are <strong>recessive</strong> (they only show up if you have two).
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🍀 <strong>Example:</strong>  
    If <code>D</code> = dimples (dominant) and <code>d</code> = no dimples (recessive):  
    - <code>DD</code> = Dimples  
    - <code>Dd</code> = Dimples  
    - <code>dd</code> = No Dimples  
  </div>

  <p>
    Scientists also talk about <strong>genotype</strong> and <strong>phenotype</strong>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genotype</strong>: Your gene combo (like <code>Dd</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Phenotype</strong>: What you actually look like (you have dimples!)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧠 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some people think cilantro tastes like soap. That’s actually a genetic trait! If it tastes fine to you, you don’t have the “soap gene.”
  </div>

  <p>
    Genetics isn’t just about looks — it helps doctors understand diseases, helps farmers grow better crops, and explains why no two people (except identical twins) are exactly the same.
  </p>

  <h2>🧬 DNA and Genes</h2>
 <p>
    Inside almost every cell in your body is a tiny control center called the <strong>nucleus</strong>. Inside the nucleus? A molecule called <strong>DNA</strong> — short for <em>Deoxyribonucleic Acid</em>. DNA holds the instructions that make you... well, <em>you</em>!
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    📦 <strong>Think of DNA as a recipe book</strong> — it tells your body how to make proteins, which are the building blocks of everything from muscles to eye color.
  </div>

  <p>
    DNA is shaped like a twisted ladder — scientists call this shape a <strong>double helix</strong>. The rungs of the ladder are made of chemical “letters” (A, T, C, and G), which form the code your body reads. A pairs with T and C pairs with G.
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🧩 <strong>DNA Code:</strong>  
    Just like letters make words, DNA letters make <strong>genes</strong>.  
    Each gene is a set of instructions for building one specific protein — kind of like a single recipe in a big cookbook.
  </div>

  <p>
    These genes are organized into bundles called <strong>chromosomes</strong>. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (that’s 46 in total), and together, they contain all the genetic info you inherited from your parents.
  </p>

  <div class="fun-box">
    🔍 <strong>Did you know?</strong> If you stretched out all the DNA in one cell, it would be over 6 feet long! And your body has trillions of cells — that’s a lot of DNA.
  </div>

  <p>
    So to recap:  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DNA</strong> is the master code.</li>
      <li><strong>Genes</strong> are sections of that code — recipes for proteins.</li>
      <li><strong>Chromosomes</strong> are how DNA is packed and organized.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>🌱 Mendelian Genetics</h2>

  <p>
    In the 1800s, an Austrian monk named <strong>Gregor Mendel</strong> discovered the basic rules of inheritance by experimenting with pea plants. By crossbreeding plants with different traits — like tall vs. short or green vs. yellow peas — he figured out how traits are passed from parent to offspring.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧑‍🔬 <strong>Mendel's Big Idea:</strong> Traits are controlled by "factors" (what we now call <strong>genes</strong>) that come in pairs. One from each parent.
  </div>

  <p>
    Some traits are <strong>dominant</strong> — they show up even if only one copy is present. Others are <strong>recessive</strong> — they only appear if both copies are the same.
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🌿 <strong>Example:</strong>  
    - <code>D</code> = Dimples (dominant)  
    - <code>d</code> = No dimples (recessive)  
    - Possible combinations: <code>DD</code>, <code>Dd</code>, or <code>dd</code>
  </div>

  <p>Let’s say two parents are both <code>Dd</code> — they each have dimples, but carry one recessive allele. What might their child inherit?</p>

  <h3>What Mendel's Plants Taught Us</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🎯 Traits come in pairs (one from each parent)</li>
    <li>🎯 One allele can be dominant and hide the other</li>
    <li>🎯 Inheritance follows clear, predictable ratios</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Mutations</h2>
    <p>Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence. They can occur naturally or due to environmental factors like radiation and chemicals. Some mutations have no effect, while others can lead to genetic disorders.</p>
