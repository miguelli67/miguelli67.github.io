  <h2>🧬 What is Genetics?</h2>

  <p>
    Ever wonder why you look a bit like your parents — or why you might have your mom’s dimples and your dad’s curly hair? That’s all thanks to <strong>genetics</strong>.
  </p>

  <div class="fun-box">
    ❓ <strong>Quick Thought:</strong> Can two brown-eyed parents have a blue-eyed baby?  
    <em>(Hint: Genetics might surprise you!)</em>
  </div>

  <p>
    Genetics is the science of how traits — like hair color, dimples, or even whether cilantro tastes like soap — are passed from parents to their children.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧪 <strong>Gene:</strong> A stretch of DNA that tells your body how to build something, like a protein. Think of it like a recipe in your genetic cookbook!
  </div>

  <p>
    You get two copies of each gene — one from your mom and one from your dad. These versions are called <strong>alleles</strong>. Some alleles are <strong>dominant</strong> (they show up even if there's only one), and some are <strong>recessive</strong> (they only show up if you have two).
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🍀 <strong>Example:</strong>  
    If <code>D</code> = dimples (dominant) and <code>d</code> = no dimples (recessive):  
    - <code>DD</code> = Dimples  
    - <code>Dd</code> = Dimples  
    - <code>dd</code> = No Dimples  
  </div>

  <p>
    Scientists also talk about <strong>genotype</strong> and <strong>phenotype</strong>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Genotype</strong>: Your gene combo (like <code>Dd</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Phenotype</strong>: What you actually look like (you have dimples!)</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧠 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some people think cilantro tastes like soap. That’s actually a genetic trait! If it tastes fine to you, you don’t have the “soap gene.”
  </div>

  <p>
    Genetics isn’t just about looks — it helps doctors understand diseases, helps farmers grow better crops, and explains why no two people (except identical twins) are exactly the same.
  </p>

  <section class="section" id="dna-and-genes">
  <h2>🧬 DNA and Genes</h2>
 <p>
    Inside almost every cell in your body is a tiny control center called the <strong>nucleus</strong>. Inside the nucleus? A molecule called <strong>DNA</strong> — short for <em>Deoxyribonucleic Acid</em>. DNA holds the instructions that make you... well, <em>you</em>!
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    📦 <strong>Think of DNA as a recipe book</strong> — it tells your body how to make proteins, which are the building blocks of everything from muscles to eye color.
  </div>

  <p>
    DNA is shaped like a twisted ladder — scientists call this shape a <strong>double helix</strong>. The rungs of the ladder are made of chemical “letters” (A, T, C, and G), which form the code your body reads. A pairs with T and C pairs with G.
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🧩 <strong>DNA Code:</strong>  
    Just like letters make words, DNA letters make <strong>genes</strong>.  
    Each gene is a set of instructions for building one specific protein — kind of like a single recipe in a big cookbook.
  </div>

  <p>
    These genes are organized into bundles called <strong>chromosomes</strong>. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes (that’s 46 in total), and together, they contain all the genetic info you inherited from your parents.
  </p>

  <div class="fun-box">
    🔍 <strong>Did you know?</strong> If you stretched out all the DNA in one cell, it would be over 6 feet long! And your body has trillions of cells — that’s a lot of DNA.
  </div>

  <p>
    So to recap:  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DNA</strong> is the master code.</li>
      <li><strong>Genes</strong> are sections of that code — recipes for proteins.</li>
      <li><strong>Chromosomes</strong> are how DNA is packed and organized.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>🌱 Mendelian Genetics</h2>

  <p>
    In the 1800s, an Austrian monk named <strong>Gregor Mendel</strong> discovered the basic rules of inheritance by experimenting with pea plants. By crossbreeding plants with different traits — like tall vs. short or green vs. yellow peas — he figured out how traits are passed from parent to offspring.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧑‍🔬 <strong>Mendel's Big Idea:</strong> Traits are controlled by "factors" (what we now call <strong>genes</strong>) that come in pairs. One from each parent.
  </div>

  <p>
    Some traits are <strong>dominant</strong> — they show up even if only one copy is present. Others are <strong>recessive</strong> — they only appear if both copies are the same.
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🌿 <strong>Example:</strong>  
    - <code>D</code> = Dimples (dominant)  
    - <code>d</code> = No dimples (recessive)  
    - Possible combinations: <code>DD</code>, <code>Dd</code>, or <code>dd</code>
  </div>

  <p>Let’s say two parents are both <code>Dd</code> — they each have dimples, but carry one recessive allele. What might their child inherit?</p>

    🤯 <strong>Cool Fact:</strong> You can have the gene for a trait (like dimples) and still not show it — that’s what makes recessive alleles sneaky!

  <h3>What Mendel's Plants Taught Us</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>🎯 Traits come in pairs (one from each parent)</li>
    <li>🎯 One allele can be dominant and hide the other</li>
    <li>🎯 Inheritance follows clear, predictable ratios</li>
  </ul>

 <section class="section" id="mutations">
  <h2>🔬 Mutations</h2>

  <p>
    A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence — like a typo in your body’s instruction manual. Sometimes it’s harmless, sometimes helpful, and sometimes it can cause problems.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    ⚡ <strong>What causes mutations?</strong>  
    - Random errors during DNA copying  
    - Exposure to radiation (like UV light)  
    - Certain chemicals or viruses
  </div>

  <p>
    Mutations can affect how a gene works or how a protein is built. If the protein doesn’t function right, it can lead to genetic conditions.
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🧬 <strong>Example:</strong>  
    A mutation in the gene that makes hemoglobin can cause <strong>sickle cell disease</strong>, where red blood cells become crescent-shaped and can't carry oxygen properly.
  </div>

  <h3>🧠 Types of Mutations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Substitution:</strong> One base is swapped for another (e.g., A → G)</li>
    <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> Extra base(s) are added to the sequence</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> One or more bases are removed</li>
    <li><strong>Frameshift:</strong> Caused by insertion/deletion; it shifts the whole code!</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="fun-box">
    🎲 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Not all mutations are bad! Some give people advantages — like resistance to certain diseases or better ability to survive in different climates.
  </div>

  <p>
    Most of the time, your cells catch and fix mutations. But if they don’t, they become part of your genetic code — and can even be passed down to children if they occur in reproductive cells.

  <h2>🔬 Modern Genetics</h2>

  <p>
    Genetics has come a long way since Mendel and his pea plants. Today, scientists use powerful tools to explore, edit, and understand genes in ways that once seemed like science fiction.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    🧪 <strong>CRISPR:</strong> A revolutionary tool that works like molecular scissors, allowing scientists to cut and edit specific genes with precision.
  </div>

  <p>
    With CRISPR and other technologies, researchers can correct faulty genes that cause diseases, modify crops to grow better, and even study extinct species by examining ancient DNA.
  </p>

  <div class="example-box">
    🧬 <strong>Example:</strong>  
    Scientists have used CRISPR to help treat sickle cell disease, a condition caused by a single genetic mutation in red blood cells.
  </div>

  <p>
    Another breakthrough was the <strong>Human Genome Project</strong> — a global effort to map all the genes in human DNA. Completed in 2003, it’s helped doctors understand and diagnose genetic conditions faster and more accurately.
  </p>

  <div class="fun-box">
    🌍 <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The Human Genome Project found that humans are 99.9% genetically identical — it’s the 0.1% that makes each person unique!
  </div>

  <p>
    As genetics advances, we’re learning more about ancestry, medicine, and what makes each of us unique — all from tiny molecules inside our cells.
